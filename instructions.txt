THE SEAR:
Step 1. Season your beef and let it sit on the counter for about 20 minutes. We’re doing this to make sure the beef isn’t straight-out-of-the-fridge cold when we add it to the pan. If the beef is cold, it reduces the heat in the pan, and it slow cooks the meat, causing it to become chewy. No thanks!! Then, place the beef in a hot oiled pan and give them a quick sear (30 seconds to a minute). The quick sear is important for the same reason as the temperature of the meat going into the pan. If you saute it for too long, it starts to get tough.

Step 2. Remove the beef and set it aside on a plate and then add the onions to the hot pan. Saute the onions for 2-3 minutes and then add in the garlic and saute for another minute or two.

Step 3. Add in the sliced mushrooms.
